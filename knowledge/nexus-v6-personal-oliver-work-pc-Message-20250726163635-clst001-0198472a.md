The NEXUS DNA Auto-Chunking & Card Generation Master Formula is a comprehensive framework designed to automatically segment various types of knowledge objects into distinct, logically separated NEXUS DNA Cards, also known as "Snippets." Each card is fully tagged and contains metadata to ensure efficient organization, searchability, and compliance with data management standards. Here's a breakdown of the key components and rules outlined in the formula:

### Key Features:

1. **Automatic Chunking:**
   - Text and multimodal content are divided into cards based on word count (every 250 words) or logical sections (e.g., chapters, slides).
   - Each card is assigned a unique identifier (UID), tags, context, cluster information, metadata, and a reference to the original source.

2. **Hierarchical Structure & Access Control:**
   - Each object includes fields for organizational hierarchy and access rights, ensuring that only authorized roles and individuals can view or edit the content.
   - Access fields include `role_access`, `person_access`, and `external_access`.

3. **Output Formats:**
   - Cards are generated in both Markdown (.md) and JSON formats for readability and integration with APIs and automation systems.

4. **Searchability and Referencing:**
   - Each card is designed to be independently searchable, linkable, and referenceable.
   - The source link is critical for compliance and data ownership verification.

5. **Handling Mixed Modalities:**
   - For inputs with mixed modalities (e.g., PDFs with text and images), separate cards are created for each modality and logical unit, with references to the main object.

6. **Verification and Compliance:**
   - Each card includes a verification status and fields for GDPR compliance, confidentiality, and retention policies.
   - Content rating is mandatory, with options like "neutral," "adult," "confidential," and "private."

7. **Metadata and Indexing:**
   - Cards include metadata such as creation and last updated timestamps, content size, and entry context.
   - An index card is created for each series of objects, summarizing the sequence and meta-information.

8. **Calendar/Appointment Enhancements:**
   - For calendar entries, the system recognizes names, times, locations, and activities, generating extensive search tags and synonym tags for each entity.

### Example Card Structure:

The example provided illustrates how a card is structured, including fields like UID, tags, title, summary, key points, hierarchy, access rights, GDPR compliance, and more. The card also includes a source link for verification and compliance purposes.

Overall, the NEXUS DNA Auto-Chunking & Card Generation Master Formula is designed to streamline the organization and management of diverse knowledge objects, ensuring they are easily accessible, compliant, and efficiently integrated into various systems and workflows.
