PostSee new postsConversationBrian Armstrong@brian_armstrongExciting update: Coinbase has partnered with @perplexity_ai to help traders get access to real-time trusted crypto data/info for better decision making. The first stage is going live today, and there's more to come: Phase 1 (now): Perplexity is now ingesting our market data, including COIN50, and using it to power market analysis. Users can double click into price moves to help make better informed trade decisions. The demo below shows what it looks like on Comet, Perplexity’s new browser. Also, the Perplexity team shared that just as many users are looking up crypto as equities, which is a cool stat. Crypto is going mainstream. Phase 2 (soon): Coinbase’s market data will be used in Perplexity’s responses to user queries. Traders will be able to monitor market activity, screen for trade ideas, and analyze token-specific moves in an AI-powered conversational interface. This integration was made seamless by our @CoinbaseDev platform. Love to see more use cases here! I expect enhanced crypto functionality will be a catalyst for AI to achieve another 10x unlock. Personally I’m most excited to see crypto wallets fully integrated into LLMs one day. That will be a huge step towards a permissionless, digital economy. And today, this new access to reliable real-time data via increasingly intelligent LLMs will help lots more people make smart, informed decisions about crypto. It’s a great step forward! @AravSrinivas and the team at Perplexity are amazing - I’m excited to be starting this journey with them.3:26 PM · Jul 10, 2025·764.6K Views4097725.1K1KPost your replyReplyak47monster@AK47M0NSTER·Jul 10Why does coinbase always crash54244Tejpal Singh@0xTejpal·Jul 10Exciting! If you're curious on how far we are from LLMs making transactions, we released a benchmark for this (TxnBench) and an RL environment to train on (TxnGym) within @NousResearch cc @AravSrinivas @jerallaire @jessepollakQuoteOpenBlock@openblocklabs·Jun 191/ Introducing TxnGym: a reinforcement-learning environment where LLMs learn to turn your intents into valid transactions –– powered by @NousResearch’s Atropos, @Circle’s @USDC, and a fork of @Base.11982Dεvolvεd AI@devolvedai·Jul 10Huge step forward but the next frontier might be agents that don’t just consume market data, but evolve by acting on it. That’s what we're building - on-chain learning through staked decisions, scored performance, and validator feedback.
