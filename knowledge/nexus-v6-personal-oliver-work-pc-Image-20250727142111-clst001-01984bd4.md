The NEXUS DNA Auto-Chunking & Card Generation Master Formula outlines a comprehensive framework for automatically splitting various types of knowledge objects (text, images, audio, video, PDFs, links, data, messages, mixed media) into distinct, logically separated NEXUS DNA Cards, also known as "snippets." Each card is fully tagged and contains specific metadata to ensure efficient organization, retrieval, and compliance.

### Key Features of the Formula:

1. **Auto-Chunking Rules:**
   - Text and multimodal content exceeding 250 words are divided into individual cards for each 250-word section.
   - Logically recognizable sections (e.g., chapters, slides, emails) are each converted into a single card.
   - Optional combination of chunking by logical unit and word count.

2. **Card Metadata:**
   - Each card includes a unique identifier (UID), tags, context, cluster information, metadata, and a reference to the original source.
   - Hierarchical and access rights fields are mandatory, detailing organizational structure and access permissions.

3. **Output Formats:**
   - Cards are generated in both Markdown (.md) and JSON formats to ensure readability and compatibility with APIs and automation systems.

4. **Searchability and Referencing:**
   - Each card is independently searchable, linkable, and referable, with a critical emphasis on maintaining a source link for compliance and data ownership.

5. **Handling Mixed Modalities:**
   - For inputs with mixed modalities (e.g., PDFs with text and images), separate cards are created for each modality and logical unit, always referencing the main object.

6. **Verification and Compliance:**
   - Cards include a self-check/verification field, GDPR compliance fields, and content rating.

7. **Index Card:**
   - An index card is created for each series of objects (e.g., projects, meetings) to summarize and provide meta-information.

### Example Card Output:

The example provided demonstrates a card for an image object, detailing its UID, tags, summary, key points, hierarchy, access rights, and more. It also includes a verification status and a source link, ensuring the card is compliant and traceable.

This formula is designed to be GDPR/MCP/Enterprise-ready, with fields for access rights, roles, data protection officer (DPO) approval, confidentiality, and retention policies. It supports a maximum of 50 cards per object, with a warning issued if this limit is reached.
