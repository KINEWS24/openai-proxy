The NEXUS DNA Auto-Chunking & Card Generation Master Formula is a comprehensive framework designed to automatically split various knowledge objects into standalone, logically separated NEXUS DNA Cards, or "snippets." These cards are fully tagged and contain metadata for efficient organization and retrieval. Here's a breakdown of the key components and rules outlined in the formula:

### Key Features:

1. **Automatic Chunking:**
   - Text and multimodal content exceeding 250 words is divided into cards, each containing a 250-word section.
   - Logically recognizable sections (e.g., chapters, slides, emails) are treated as individual cards.
   - Optional combination of chunking by logical unit and word count.

2. **Card Structure:**
   - Each card includes a unique identifier (UID), tags, context, cluster information, metadata, and a source reference.
   - Cards have fields for `ParentUID`, `ChunkNr`, and `TotalChunks` to indicate their relationship to the original object.
   - A critical requirement is the inclusion of an original link reference for document access.

3. **Hierarchy and Access Control:**
   - Objects have fields for organizational hierarchy and access rights, specifying who can view or edit the content.
   - Hierarchy is represented as an array or individual fields for organization, department, team, role, and person.
   - Access fields include `role_access`, `person_access`, and `external_access`.

4. **Output Formats:**
   - Cards are output in both .md (Markdown) and .json formats for readability and machine processing.
   - The content is searchable, linkable, and referable.

5. **Verification and Compliance:**
   - Each card ends with a verification status, indicating whether it is verified or requires a check.
   - GDPR and enterprise readiness are ensured with fields for access rights, roles, data protection officer (DPO) approval, confidentiality, and retention policy.

6. **Content Rating and Related Modalities:**
   - A mandatory `content_rating` field categorizes content as neutral, adult, confidential, or private.
   - Complex objects can include related modalities and embedded objects.

7. **Metadata and Limits:**
   - Cards include creation and last updated timestamps in ISO8601 format.
   - A standard limit of 50 cards per object is set, with a warning in the root chunk if exceeded.
   - An index card summarizes the sequence and metadata for each object series.

### Example Output:
The example provided illustrates a DNA Card for an image object, detailing its UID, tags, summary, key points, hierarchy, access rights, and more, in both Markdown and JSON formats.

### Additional for Calendar/Events:
- The system recognizes names, times, places, and activities, generating extensive search tags and synonym tags for each entity.

This formula ensures that knowledge objects are efficiently organized, accessible, and compliant with data protection standards, making it suitable for enterprise environments.
