The document you provided outlines a comprehensive framework for automatically chunking and generating NEXUS DNA Cards from various knowledge objects. Here's a summary of the key components and rules:

1. **Automatic Chunking and Tagging**: Every knowledge object, regardless of its type (text, image, audio, video, etc.), is automatically split into independent, logically separated NEXUS DNA Cards, each fully tagged.

2. **Chunking Rules**:
   - For text exceeding 250 words, create a card for every 250-word section.
   - For logically recognizable sections (like chapters, slides, etc.), each unit becomes a card.
   - Cards receive unique identifiers, tags, context, metadata, and a reference to the original source.

3. **Hierarchy and Access Control**:
   - Each object includes fields for organizational hierarchy and access permissions, specifying who can view or edit the object.

4. **Output Formats**:
   - Cards are output in both .md (Markdown) and .json formats for readability and automation, ensuring field consistency.

5. **Verification and Compliance**:
   - Each card includes a verification status and fields for GDPR compliance, confidentiality, and retention policies.

6. **Content Rating and Metadata**:
   - Cards have a mandatory content rating field and include metadata such as creation and last updated timestamps.

7. **Index Card**:
   - An index card is created for each series of objects, summarizing and organizing the sequence and metadata.

The framework ensures that each card is searchable, linkable, and referable, with a strong emphasis on maintaining source links for compliance and data ownership.
