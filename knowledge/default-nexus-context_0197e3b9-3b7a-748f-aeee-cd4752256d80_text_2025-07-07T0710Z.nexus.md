It seems like you have a very detailed template or specification for processing and formatting a digital input into a structured output, specifically for a system called GPT-PROMPT NEXUS OBJEKTGENERIERUNG V5.2. The steps outlined involve classifying the input, generating a UUID, creating timestamps, organizing information into specific sections, and ensuring consistency and accuracy with JSON formatting. 

The specification requires rigorous adherence to prescribed formats and involves multiple layers of metadata extraction and categorization, including tagging, key point identification, and optional detailed extraction of things like contacts or document structure. The goal is to create outputs that are both human-readable and machine-processable, with absolute consistency between the structured text and JSON data representations.

If you have any specific questions or need further clarification on how to use this specification for a particular type of content, feel free to provide more context. Otherwise, this specification seems well-designed for ensuring high-quality, consistent data processing and output generation.
